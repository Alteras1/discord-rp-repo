While the brunt of the attack had been focused towards Williamstown, many other portals had popped out scattered outside of it. Soldiers and guards were quick to act in order to protect the people. Yet there were some places more scattered across the region that weren't quite as lucky.\n\nIt was one such town nestled along the wilderness that had found it's unfortune luck having drawn a small portal from which several demons had wormed thier way into the town. They had managed to cause some havoc forcing the few protectors to action along with it's own small militia of able bodied citizens. In the end they managed to triumph though not without many injured and several casualties from the sudden attack.\n\nIt had been shortly after the situation had been difused with the three cloaked figures had arrived. Appearing rather humble in appearanmce the three had approached the town seeking to provide aid. A gesture that given the dire state many of the citizens were in it was something they could use any help they could.\n\n**\"Relax... simply ease your mind.

Meanwhile, a shadow of flight landed on the rooftops of one of the houses, gliding from top to top.\n\nAmong the crowd many applauded the efforts of the wolfs dress as sheep, and the women healed them one by one, as time passed the circle of bodies grew ever larger to witness such miracles.\n\n‚ÄúNow now, pray tell of yourselves, oh followers of Adix.‚Äù\n\nThe cluster of bystanders split nearly in half to make way for a presence of a man covered in rugged cloth.

Unsurprising as it was, he still disliked it. James had assumed the conversation was doomed from the start it, but any further pestering would likely simply result in the women continuing to dodge questions.

This would fall in line with the guild preferred actions of morality to not endanger other unrelated lives. They could observe the members from afar and gain information toward their intentions, since there was always a chance they were not malicious.\nAnd his fallen efforts to converse had spoken to the validity of this decision.

The shadows from the backlight covering his brown clothing wrapped around to lay over his face. \n\n‚ÄúWe live in a world of magic beings more powerful than anything that could be imagined, catalysts of world ending design which hover on the horizon by our own doing, and all while the countries of this world think only of themselves.‚Äù \n\nJames raised both of his hands and looked around, bringing attention to the invasion which had just taken place. During the action he subtly grabbed an image of ICorus in the distance. He was unable to communicate with her, a large oversight in his plan. She would be unable to warn them of major changes in mana, and likewise could not hear what he was saying to Zaria.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is a man to do in this world but seek to actions which benefit him and him alone. How else can we survive other than to horde our resources and hide underneath a rock hoping for the best?‚Äù\n\nJames took steps forward toward her. ‚ÄúDo you consider yourself a gambling woman?‚Äù\n\nAround Zaria symbols of magic formed orchestrated by ICorus, and ice shards lifted to trap the woman in a binding of ice.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a bet.

As her body crossed halfway point between their distance the rift opened to pull the three of them in. \n\nJames would catch the smallest glimpse of ICorus‚Äôs motions before the teleportation. The ripples of the rift stretched across the landscape changing the scenery. When the spell had finished, they laid within the shrouded forest some distance away. \n\nShadows clotted his vision, blood running. Within his mind a voice screamed to run. Fear, genuine mind-numbing fear consumed him. \n\nThough he was not versed well in complex magics, the alteration of another's a spell designed to open a rift between two locations was far beyond his understanding, and she did it with the flick of a wrist. \n\nBut before he would have his chance to futher ponder, the mineral connection within the ground cracked open to pull out an eruption of gold links. Smashing to the ground around him and rupturing outward to chain him down. Likewise, Zi fell to a similar fate of the opposite location. \n\nJames let out several volleys of shots toward Zaria while dashing away. As the enhanced metal structures of the bullet make contact with the barrier, every molecule down to a singular level split seamlessly.

Some fell to war, others fell to time, still others lost their reason to live. One by one each life ended and rose again to end.

To take everything into the eternal peace of slumber.\n\nMy eyes returned to me, and the despair consumed my body. The feathers on the outer edges stained black and mana of the void took hold over me. Consuming and changing my form to reflect my thoughts.\n\nMy gaze turned to her. ‚ÄúMircle Priestess‚Ä¶.save us.‚Äù","timestamp":"2024-05-07T03:47:56.920000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-05-07T03:49:37.120000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":21,"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1237263878635913216","channel_id":"1169107547899318293","author":{"id":"212762756271570945","username":"hanarei","avatar":"b4ec551b8ded8fb3122be58eb9a179b2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Hanarei","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Zaria's eyes stared coldly at the men... though no... perhaps such a description was ill apt. It wasn't a lack of empathy, it was as if she gazing past them. Her very emotions projected on a plane beyond what most could perceive. Their expressions, their actions, it was all taken in as she simply looked on.\n\nIt wasn't ambivalence, but that of concern. A worried mother watching her treasured 'children' struggling yet unable to do anything but forced to watch them go through their own trials. All she did was 'bless' them with what knowledge they lack, the truth that their own blissful ignorance was having them so foolishly reject.\n\nHer footsteps clicked on the ground as she approached as if the very ground, she stepped on was marble. It was almost soothing as it was haunting. The 'static' that was the horrors her curse inflicted almost seeming to fade away as if she was some divine deity approaching. The horrors still lingered yet it was as if she was in some part soothing it. Dulling the shadow that encroached the mind. \n\nShe stared down towards you, resting now upon your knees looking upon her with such distant eyes. The words slipping free from your lips as she smiled warmly. The clicking of heels echoing out once more as she approached the void sitting behind her in such a distorted vision. Her hand slowly lifted to gently trace along your head brushing through it.\n\n\"It is all right... I shall give you that salvation... simply embrace such truths... for with it and my guidance you are sure to find the right path... to transcend the abyss.\" \n\nShe spoke her voice lofty as she took hold of you, gently pressing them into her warm embrace like that of a mother holding her child. Your face pressed within her bosom as if to offer salvation clearing away the horrors lurking within the mind, only escapable being within her hold.","timestamp":"2024-05-07T04:44:55.918000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-05-07T05:06:26.563000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":22,"userName":"hanarei"}]
