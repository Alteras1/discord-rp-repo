The Guildmaster stopped all actions and took to battle. Multiple Guild members and upstanding citizens also engaged in battle against demons while most civilians retreated into various safe zones. An emergency Guild wide announcement was made calling all able members to arms. Communications also confirmed the appearance of portals across much of Albion as well, limiting efforts to bring more reinforcements to Fort Grey and Williamstown.\n\n...\n\nWhile the attack was successfully repelled, much of Williamstown remain in ruins. Immediate relief efforts are being organized and sent across town and all over albion. Currently it is unclear what is the situation in areas beyond the Fort's vicinity.\n\nIt is also unclear what is the exact purpose of the invasion and what prompted the subsequent retreat. Corroborating accounts from other long distance detection and surveillance specialists and myself seem to indicate that the demons were searching for something. However, neither I nor anyone else was able to identify the demons taking anyone or thing. I speculate that the goal is to locate their target. And that their invasion may simply be a distraction and a preemptive strike to weaken the Guild for future activities.\n\n*‚Äî Pathfinder Ilya*\n\nRelated threads:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1163548340030554143\nhttps://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1163544739728068678\nhttps://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1163596429437186181\nhttps://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1163974660107550803\nhttps://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1163976177845796900","timestamp":"2023-10-27T16:08:47.539000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-27T16:13:32.261000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"alteras"},{"id":"1167495188336365599","channel_id":"1167495117674926220","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Quest Submissions**\n**REBUILD THE RUINS** - Do what you can to help the town recover.
