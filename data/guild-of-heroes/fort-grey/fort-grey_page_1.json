It was difficult to identify, though, since there wasn't really any forewarning or sign or evidence. One instant, they had been stepping off her ship and into the albionian port, and the next instant, they stepped onto an entirely different port, an unfamiliar ship behind them. In some sense it was a fortunate transposition, since this Other-Albion was seemingly free of Script's rulership, but it still left her with only the contents of her void pocket and Adam's backpack. No boundless riches, no center of power, no expansive criminal empire. Only the lingering knowledge that those things had all been a lie to start with, strings for the Knower of Names to pull her around like a puppet with. Maybe it's better to go without. Hopefully Vance would be alright without their help.\n\nAnother part of her considered the local Guild of Heroes. Undefeated and ascendant, headed by a distinctly...*ominous* figure. Working along with them seemed like the only feasible choice, for now at least, and may well be the best option long term, especially given her intent to try and avoid the path the Knower had set forth for her. Working underneath others rankled her, deeply, but hopefully she would be able to prove her value and rise to masterhood soon enough.\n\nA third part of her considered the various snacks available from the various hawkers set up around the fair. She'd been devouring a continuous stream of them from the great pile that Adam was balancing between his arm and chest. Albionian cuisine was unfamiliar to her, but fairfood wasn't, and there some inescapable similarities. Candied fruit and fried dough, excellently made and deliciously sweet and oily. A comfort she hadn't expected to need, but which she found all too necessary.","timestamp":"2023-10-16T21:56:47.772000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"fibonacci_reminder"},{"id":"1163596582814494760","channel_id":"1163548340030554143","author":{"id":"179260464956440576","username":"gabbie0w0","avatar":"733fb651107eec3a4a024a017c0d3186","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Gabbie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"“Dropping the princess is what you should do, evildoer!” Isabella chided with a finger wag, suppressing a giggle with a semi audible snort. “It was a ploy to free her from your devious grasp!”","timestamp":"2023-10-16T21:57:23.922000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"gabbie0w0"},{"id":"1163597012764217404","channel_id":"1163548340030554143","author":{"id":"416005934410891274","username":"oliviatpines","avatar":"fe5db61498b4c18482afc955dfe36275","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Olivia T Pines","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Getting up afterwards with a pep in his step and a massive gleaming smile on his face he resumes hugging his friend!

Most likely because I haven’t been around Albion much. Since then, I have primarily been in Espania and Laurellia. I have spent almost half a year in those combined. But I recently returned to Visuden and that’s when this request got handed over to me.”\n\nAs they entered one of the lounge areas Circley took the cue and sat down. She looked back to her assistant, and he pulled out a booklet full of different papers. \nHe briefly shuffled a moment before pulling out a rather large, folded paper and handed it to her. Circley laid the paper out across a table which centered the room.\n\n“In relation to this request. As you already know, Visudens capital Lithos has a complicated past with its environment. During the early months of the year the rain can become extremely deadly in quantity, as such large guidance tunnels were created underneath the city, and now are used to help create power as well.\n\nDuring the current time of year however, the rain is minimal, and the tunnels largely go used. It had never been a problem before, but now it seems a group of what we believe are Eldorians, have made a hideout down there. Due to the complicated nature of the place, it’s difficult to weed them out, so that is where you come in.\n\nPhoe is revealing a new invention in a couple days at a yearly festival, so they should be cleared out by then. This map will show you the routes as well as the entrances, of which there are four.”\n\nCircley pulled back giving Ilya time to think over the information, while she leaned against the fabric of the of the chair.\n\n“All in all, their force isn’t particularly large, and Visuden will be assisting in the cleanup as well. Your main job will be finding out what they are doing, and destroying the leadership.\"\n\nShe paused again.\n\n\"Any questions?”","timestamp":"2023-10-26T01:40:46.145000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":"590500275979157524","name":"pepeglasses"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1166960098455863396","channel_id":"1166538294805405746","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Ilya set down a cup of tea before Circley as she received the paper from the assistant.

My guess for what’s below Lithos…is a trap.”\n\nCircley pointed to the four entrances of the underground tunnel system, the *only* four entrances.\n\n“These are the singular ways in or out of the system. If it truly is Eldorian members below, they probably intend for us to march an army underneath our own city to clear them out.\nBut what would happen if right after that army walked in, the exits collapse and trapped a section of the Visuden military underneath their city?”\n\nShe raised her hand into the air pointing toward the floor.\n\n“And suddenly with a large portion of Visuden effort being spent attempting to save their citizen from the labyrinth below the city, Eldor walks on to our doorstep? \n\nYou see this isn’t simply a group of fanatical Eldorian believers, played incorrectly this may be a declaration of war…”\n\nShe didn’t say it, but given the nature of Visudens actions, the cultivation of houses that run it also came to this conclusion. It was also the reason they were clearing this with a small elite force instead of a larger one.\n\n“With the Guild involved, Visuden is backed by a morally neutral group and is given more elite members to ensure success. Additionally, Eldor is less likely to pull any major stunts since the death of any guild member would result in a powerful enemy.\n\nIf the guilds quest is to keep peace, this would be the best way to see the dawn.”\n\nCircley gave time for Ilya to respond, afterward she would call back for the butler to return and then suggest they make their way toward the airship, and other questions could be answered along the way.

Put negatively, *become bait.*\n\nStill, Circley's final words were correct. The Guild's and this *quest's* mission are ultimately the same: *to keep the peace.* In this situation where the Guild and the whole of Albion faced a sudden invasion from demons with an unknown objective, Melicau couldn't afford to split itself on a possible internal war. The Guild of Heroes *must* accept this quest.\n\nStanding up slowly, Ilya looked at the Visuden representative. Raising her arm in the Pathfinder salute, and with as much confidence she could muster, said \"On behalf of the Guild of Heroes, Pathfinder Ilya Reyes hereby accepts this quest. Of course I have some further questions, but its best to wait for a party to form before I continue.\"\n\nLeading the representatives out of the lounge and back towards their airship, Ilya stopped by the receptionist once more.

Masterful, and professional; affording their client with the secrecy they warranted, and keeping the party of heroes safe from scrutiny should the worse happen. \n\nShe would have plenty of time to rib the woman who actually tacked something as trite as \"protect the smiles of the innocent\" on an Empire's request for all to read and admire later. For now, Carter had the precious and short-lived luxury of keeping her shoulders loose, savoring the moist, buttery croissants piled generiously before them, and pondering what exactly friendship with Circley Selhorn, who joined the table, may entail. \n\nWashing away the last bite of a croissant with warm tea, Carter followed Ilya after a polite pause. \n\n**\"If the interlopers are found, would you be interested in having us bring back bodies for you?\"** She ventured quietly, unsure, truly, how Visuden may intend to treat their long-time adversaries, **\"Another question comes to mind, assuming the suspected Eldorian Hideout is hidden deeper ... what typical traps should we anticipate on our way? The textbooks I read favor the might and tactics of Visuden and little else, unfortunately.\"** She smiled toothily.","timestamp":"2023-10-31T04:38:42.929000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":"813896753802641433","name":"SagaNom","animated":true},"count":2,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":2},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":true,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"_coiiapse"},{"id":"1168968086095937566","channel_id":"1166538294805405746","author":{"id":"108757318849531904","username":"reinhardt","avatar":"813677b2ff03227a8e1268244a07f228","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Reinhardt","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"At the last few moments before the airship took off, a blonde woman was escorted by two guild staff to board the said vessel, and even followed her into the very ship's interior, leaving only just before the vessel took to the skies.\n\nApparently, she had been in a rather heated discourse with some of the guild staff, including a receptionist, about the guild's response to the recent attack - specifically on its seeming inaction on hunting down the fiends responsible for the disturbance.\n\nLong story short, she had been convinced that the guild was indeed taking the necessary actions, but were prioritizing on handling more urgent matters - such as recuperating from the damages. Clearly, it was not by her own choice that she had taken on this quest.\n\n---\n\nWhen the time for questions and concerns came, the two, more experienced members of the guild were quick to voice out.

Circley briefly held the side of the chair tighter to regain some composer, gently pulling back several of the hairs that had fallen out of place. She took the brief pause as an excuse to think more over what she wanted to say.\n\n“There is something I have neglected to tell you. Though it is not uncommon knowledge that Lithos was founded at the desire to mine out a substantial Orcobras cavern, many people forget the sheer size of the mine. It is not impossible that the enemy will have found lingering crystal veins. I would expect to go up against the primary elements which Orcobras can store, to what extend however, I know not. Expect Eldor to be clever and have the upper hand from the shadows. That's as much as I know as far as traps go. \n\nRegarding your question Carter. You will be joined with a Visuden warrior named Behemoth, it will be his job to identify the leader and deliver his remains back to us. He will also assist you in finding them as well.”\n\nAs Circley finished answering the question one of the attendants came to address the group. The ship would be landing soon on the outer edges of Lithos.","timestamp":"2023-11-02T01:15:41.456000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":"356262496501497857","name":"blobsalute"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0},{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"🛳️"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1169449542803001456","channel_id":"1166538294805405746","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**continued in https://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1167917480249929819**","timestamp":"2023-11-02T01:34:58.326000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://discord.com/channels/796570401681309696/1167917480249929819**","title":"Discord - A New Way to Chat with Friends & Communities","description":"Discord is the easiest way to communicate over voice, video, and text.
