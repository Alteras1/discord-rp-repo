Attracted to coin and wealth.\n**High Concept**: A master merchant woman whom loves coin; but there's something more there. \n**Backstory**: Reports about Anna are conflicting. What's for certain is that there's more than one of them. All are red-headed, caucasian-esque women who are inclined heavily towards capitalism and money. There's even been multiple reports of things such as an Adult Anna with one or more young, child-like, Anna's. If they are just a family of mainly/exclusively female businesswomen whom all just happen to look alike or if there's something more going on is unclear.\n\nWhen it comes to this specific Anna there's a bit more that is known. She is a merchant-woman whom has worked with the various guilds and adventurers for the past several years and, in that time, has gone from being a young teen girl eager to make her first sale to being an adult, and highly business-saavy, woman who reguarly supplies weapons, items, and other things to the various adventurers who need them. She can be trusted to offer fair, even generous, deals though she's also heavily inclined towards earning coin and will rarely give things for free. Her friendly nature and generally beneficial attitude has kept her in good standings with people though. She's also in no way adverse to getting her own hands dirty and will frequently assist other adventurers in their quests. When she was younger this was mainly as a support, though as she's matured she's become capable in combat magics and picked up some weapon skills.","timestamp":"2023-10-14T00:07:20.410000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-14T00:37:26.531000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üëç"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"snowtwo"},{"id":"1162544660779106304","channel_id":"1162542118179459182","author":{"id":"307753079242227712","username":"snowtwo","avatar":"40ebca2985042734e11ca52b78450f7a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Snowtwo","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"","timestamp":"2023-10-14T00:17:26.165000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1162544660519071814","filename":"images.jpg","size":8750,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162542118179459182/1162544660519071814/images.jpg?ex=66a8d9d6&is=66a78856&hm=5c34061da15f68d16a3ad86416a31b28fc0fd8526b54a6dbb6cef945c9aab294&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1162542118179459182/1162544660519071814/images.jpg?ex=66a8d9d6&is=66a78856&hm=5c34061da15f68d16a3ad86416a31b28fc0fd8526b54a6dbb6cef945c9aab294&","width":192,"height":262,"content_type":"image/jpeg","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"UigGFQSel8+ZSJYoiHp5hz7fxPZc","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"snowtwo"},{"id":"1162549771106529290","channel_id":"1162542118179459182","author":{"id":"307753079242227712","username":"snowtwo","avatar":"40ebca2985042734e11ca52b78450f7a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Snowtwo","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Affiliations**: As a merchant-woman it's important for Anna to remain affiliated with the many merchant groups in the area and keep on good relationships with them. Likewise, she's known to any adventuring guilds and adventurers and on generally decent terms with them.\n\n**Guild Rank**: Novice (Honorary)\n\n**PHYSICAL**\n**Appearance**: Image\n**Weapons & Armor**: Anna carries a variety of weapons in her shop and frequently carries an assortment of goods, including weapons and armor, to sell. This does not mean she is skilled or capable with said weapons, however. She has demonstrated minor proficiency with a bow and carries a basic sword for defense, but her true inclination is magic. Though she does wear some very light armor, she is effectively unarmored, mainly due to her main line of work, once again, being non-combat.\n**Items & Personal Belongings**: Shop-wares aside, Anna owns very little for herself currently. Aside from her clothes, bow, sword, and basic belongings she currently doesn't carry much in the way of personal goods on her body. What belongings she has are kept at home and it's unclear if they really are 'hers' as opposed to 'Anna's'.\n**Skills & Abilities**: Highly capable at diplomacy, bargaining, and merchantilization. Anna is capable of working out favorable deals with ease and is like a fish in water in anything regarding wealth or coin. She is also notoriously lucky.","timestamp":"2023-10-14T00:37:44.562000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"snowtwo"},{"id":"1162549777599315988","channel_id":"1162542118179459182","author":{"id":"307753079242227712","username":"snowtwo","avatar":"40ebca2985042734e11ca52b78450f7a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Snowtwo","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Spells & Magic**: Magic is the main thing Anna has displayed an affinity for. She favors lightning-style magic, though fire is also perfectly natural to her. Much of her magic, however, tends to favor supportive and helpful stuff such as healing wounds or absorbing enemy spells. If allowed to grow as a mage she will likely advance to spells that allow for such things as time manipulation (Haste/slow) though she certainly won't be neglecting offensive magic.\n**Weaknesses**: She's not terribly strong physically in any way, being no stronger than an average woman of her age and profession. She's not about to bench an elephant or survive being swatted by a boulder. She doesn't wear heavy armor or anything and her weapon skills, even with those she's shown affinities for, aren't that great.\n**Other**: Anna is part of a family of women, all named Anna, whom are highly similar physically. What this actually MEANS is unclear, if it is natural or the hands of the gods are involved.\n\nSpoiler (The Truth): ||Anna is not a 'real' person. Rather, the Anna's are meant to serve as vessels for a goddess of capitalism (also named Anna). When not being used they're allowed to live their own lives and such, but the reason for the extreme homogeny is so that any one of them can become a vessel for their goddess at any time. It is possible this also means they share a conciousness, though not even they are sure if this is a quirk of their nature or, rather, the result of lingering knowledge from their goddess.\n||\n**Hobbies**: When not engaged in merchanting Anna enjoys singing, dancing, and is heavily inclined towards finding ways to distinguish herself from her family.\n**Quote\\s**: 'Capitalism Ho!'

She currently needs to attend her basic orientation, but the guild is fairly understanding on timing, given her condition.\n\n**PERSONAL**\n**Sexuality**: Pending\n**High Concept**: What if your only memory was that of someone murdered before you?

To be clever and cunning is all she has over monsters that can level an army.\n\n**Spells & Magic**:\n\n*The Gift of a Black Cat:* Simra can place memories within an object to allow her to control the object with her mind. During that time, she loses the memory, and if the object is destroyed while being controlled, the memory is lost forever. There are a couple of limitations.\n\n*Conflicting Will:* She can never control anything that has a will of its own. Even if it desires it.\n\n*Weight of Sin:* The memory must either be of a fairly large amount of time, or something that plays a key place in her life. For example, why she knows someone, what they have done for her, the reason she took certain actions. \n\n*Strings:* The object can only move with its own capacity. No flying without reason or being super strong. And there is a limit to the size she can control. Anything bigger than three times herself is likely not going to work.\n\n*Length of Silk:* There is a limit to the distance she can control an object. If this distance is too great, she will lose control over the object permanently. The only way to regain the memory is to touch the object again.\n\n*Endless Servitude:* If Simra‚Äôs main host is destroyed while she is still controlling at least one puppet, her soul will jump to nearest the puppet. However, all the memories placed inside the host body are lost, and she is left only with the memory the doll contains. Additionally, if any other puppets are being controlled when she jumps, she will permanently lose control of them.\n\n*A unique circumstance creates‚Ä¶..:* If a strong enough memory is inside of a doll when its lost ???????\n\n\n**Weaknesses**: \nDestroying Simra‚Äôs host is the same as killing her. Given the nature, she may even join you if you play it correctly.\n\nHer host is not strong.\n\nSimra‚Äôs entire strategy relies on controlling puppets, but since there is a range, it means she is never too far from her workers.

In-between such terrain formations, a thin metal contraption fueled by immense heat cut through the white sheets along an iron path. \n\nAs the shards of ice fell, pelting the steaming plates, they were shifted into an alternate state, running off the sides of the locomotive to be refrozen again.  Shattered by the disturbance, each new flake of snow connected in recuperation over time to return their once prior blanket of white.\n\nTwo hundred and seventeen nobles, of the government of Eldor, who openly dissented against their country‚Äôs actions were attempting to be smuggle across an old, abandoned railway that passed through Albions northern border. This treacherous act took place at the will of the country of Visuden, and by consequence the Selhorn family.\n\nThe model of this particular train was named The Culter. The Selhorn families first major invention in terms of locomotives. The design would later be stolen by Eldor engineers and the Selhorns would be forced to spend an insurmountable amount of money to purchase a much higher tech design from Zeiraam, for which Eldor had no answer to currently. As a result, the Culter fell outdated and to the general public‚Äôs use. Its major flaw being that if the condensed crystalline mana it runs off is shattered under high pressure it becomes highly volatile.\n\nUpon this railway sung an orchestra of spiraling industry and within the sturdy machine, voices of the passengers weaved into chaotic echoes of static vibrations. Down the center of the isle marched a monster of a lifeform deemed Behemoth. An elite member of Visuden‚Äôs military altered by experiments of enhancement. It was not uncommon to hear stories of Behemoth beating unwinnable odds, turning the tides instantly upon entering a battlefield. Chance encounters with him are fatal at the best of times.\n\nBehemoth‚Äôs destination lay in the back of the vehicle, in the cargo area. Just prior moments before, many of the crewmen spoke of unusual cargo being loaded onto the train, although the inventory specifications had allegedly met the requirements for departure, Behemoth had enough experience to check.\n\nAnd he was right. As he opened the door the raw structure of his cortex was torn asunder by the bullet of a revolver. As the shattering pulse of sounds crossed the carts, he fell to the ground. Behemoth is entirely unkillable by normal means, if any of his body is destroyed it will regenerate in time, and if the whole is incinerated it will regenerate at the capital. \n\nGiven rough estimates, Simra figured she had around ten minutes till his brain rebuilt itself.","timestamp":"2023-10-14T01:24:53.672000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-14T02:04:12.208000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1162561652286312468","channel_id":"1162560985295495219","author":{"id":"214058147499868160","username":"kyroscript","avatar":"8d00af5699209435f00ea5ac61a9e81b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Simra called out, from within the storage area metal dolls began climbing out the windows and across the train making their way toward the engine.

After two minutes several military officers had come to apprehend Simra after hearing the shot. Without any real chance of success, she gave herself up and was held within the northern section for questioning.\n\n\nThe sentries of refined stone piled into the engine room along with Behemoth. The lifeless puppets swarmed into the exhaust to block the relief of the machine‚Äôs energy source. The heat enraged the molecules within the chamber suffocating the raw crystals in a sea of its waste.\n\nOne minute and fifty seconds before Behemoth would awake Simra‚Äôs body burst shockwaves of flame.\n\nA high compound of explosives from within her body would ravage the outside world.

For the working staff of various guild halls across Melicau, their whispers talk of those who walk through their doors. From rumors of celebrity appearances to ill mannered customers and enigmatic figures, all are not above the scrutiny of a staffer. However, few rumors are as widespread as the sightings of the Wandering Wizard, a figure who seems to be everywhere and nowhere at once, always in the wind. The small side stories her appearances accompany usually include a basic description of her figure and her book, a brief yet pleasant interaction, and the prologue to a much grander tale. To many, she is a mysterious traveler, walking across far reaching distances, appearing and disappearing at towns and villages for reasons unknown. But for the staff of the Guild of Heroes, she is their ally and friend among bureaucratic paperwork, the Pathfinder Ilya Reyes.\n\nA brief search of recent years in the Guild Archive will create a timeline of Ilya Reyes‚Äôs long and storied wanderings. She joined the Guild at the age of 15, already exploring the world and carrying the arcane legacy of her family, an odd family with other mentions in the annals of history. Apparently she was found by an adventuring group of Heroes on their own quest and was convinced to join the Guild. Her own stated reason for joining is ‚Äúif I‚Äôm going to be exploring the world, might as well do some good for this world.‚Äù She was immediately placed under the attention of an experienced Master rank Pathfinder, a spellweaver who once worked as the receptionist at the HQ of the Guild. Her apprenticeship under a Pathfinder was meant to only be a way to keep up with her wandering nature, but it turned out to be a boon for the Guild. Ilya could handle a variety of intelligence gathering and processing missions, and penned many quality reports to the guild. Within those reports shone a strong understanding of the arcane and a drive for exploration and learning. Documented interactions with her have shown her to maintain a pleasant and friendly nature, an inquisitive mind, and a love of exploration. Later interviews with Ilya exposed another motive for her movements: ‚Äúto read all of my family‚Äôs compendium and to add my own words to it.‚Äù\n\nEventually a recommendation from her master and various staff members in the Guild led to her joining the Pathfinder Corp, subsequently followed by a promotion to Hero rank. At the age of 19, she began her travels independently once more, serving the Guild as one of its best Pathfinders. She has since started tales of her own, garnering a small reputation of reliability and assurance among both Guild members and staff. For those familiar with the Guild, her presence in paper is a common sight, and her presence in person is a rarity. Regardless, she remains a welcome part of the Guild of Heroes.\n‚ü°","timestamp":"2023-10-15T03:13:39.208000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"alteras"},{"id":"1162951417728864306","channel_id":"1162951296643498015","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"","timestamp":"2023-10-15T03:13:44.579000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1162951417510756423","filename":"ilya_physique.png","size":140884,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162951296643498015/1162951417510756423/ilya_physique.png?ex=66a90328&is=66a7b1a8&hm=069f0dbc0ddd936c6bc48907ec2ea1fb1bfda6aafc1bf547235ca8a87cd35644&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1162951296643498015/1162951417510756423/ilya_physique.png?ex=66a90328&is=66a7b1a8&hm=069f0dbc0ddd936c6bc48907ec2ea1fb1bfda6aafc1bf547235ca8a87cd35644&","width":900,"height":120,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"4gcOGYJQqGl4d4iGcIgIiJg=","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"alteras"},{"id":"1162951447063834664","channel_id":"1162951296643498015","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"## Appearance\nStanding at 5 foot 7 inches, Ilya moves with the steady step of a traveler. From afar, the most noticeable characteristics are the compendium by her side, her large pointy hat, and her walking stick. To those who see with magical sight, she is surrounded by an aura of mana, a result of her near constant use when traveling. Her mild smile and overall pleasant demeanor leaves an overall positive impression on those she encounters\n## Equipment\n**Weapons**\n> Reyes Compendium of the Arcane\n> Walking Stick\n> Hunting Knife\n**Armor**\n> Pointed Hat\n> Leather Top Jacket with Hidden Runes\n> Leather Gloves and Boots\n> Heavy Leather Skirt\n> Cotton shirt\n**Items**\n> A Large Bag of Holding\n> Pathfinder Tools and Equipment\n> Potions and Herbs\n> Writing Tools\n> Guild Quest Papers\n> Belts and Holsters\n## Skills & Abilities\n**Wizard of the Reyes Family Line**\n> Extremely familiar with the arcane. Carries the Reyes Compendium of the Arcane, a mix of spells from various regions, enabling a wide variety of arcane methods for any problem. Ilya has only understood half of the compendium, and must work to understand the rest and eventually add her own contributions to it.\n**Pathfinder Hero**\n> A Guild of Heroes Pathfinder of Hero rank. Her long service and quality information reports have garnered her respect from within the Guild's administrative staff. She has enough combat capability to survive the most dire of circumstances, though her strength lies in information gathering and processing. Her nature to appear and disappear sporadically at various quests and guildhalls has spawned rumors of \"The Wandering Wizard.\"\n**Wanderer**\n> Seized by the family illness of wanderlust, Ilya regularly travels from place to place, exploring anything and everything. As such, she's learned to live off the land, strength her stamina, and learn various languages. Her travels has shown her the highs and lows of the world, exposed her to a variety of skills and professions, and made herself a small personal fortune. She moves with steady step, quickly through any terrain, and without tire, with a bit of magical help.\n**Trained Magic User**\n> Early exposure to magic training, studious learning from her pathfinder predecessor, and near constant use of magic has trained her mastery and control over her abilities. Within her cohort of Heroes, she easily has one of the larger pools of mana, and fine grain control over it.\n## Magic\n**The Reyes Compendium of the Arcane**\n> As the inheritor of the Reyes family Compendium, she has access to a wide array of magical spells and arcane knowledge. As long as she wields the compendium, she can draw out any number of spells without looking, as long as she can read past her ancestors ciphers and understand the arcane meaning behind it. The compendium contains spells from various different regions and draws upon various different schools of magic. The types of magic include but are not limited to elemental, life, spatial, healing, enchantment, illusions, etc.\n**Magic Vision and Farsight**\n> Ilya is almost constantly using magic vision and farsight, alerting her to her surroundings.\n**Life Magic and Healing Magic**\n> As a well seasoned traveler, Ilya has learned how to survive and thrive in the outdoors. Light, healing, water, cooking, cleaning, everything one would need to live the nomad life.\n**Enchantment Magic**\n> Ilya almost always has enchantments that improve her traveling capabilities. This is usually strengthen, fleet foot, featherstep, and night vision.\n## Weaknesses\n**Close Quarter Combat**\n> She knows enough staff arts and defensive spells to ward off attacks, but is by no means an expert at close quarter combat\n**Ambitions of the Arcane**\n> Her goal and devotion to the studies of the Arcane have led her to some truly dire situations. Both ‚Äúcuriosity killed the cat‚Äù and ‚Äúcats have nine lives‚Äù apply to this gal.\n‚ü°","timestamp":"2023-10-15T03:13:51.573000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"alteras"},{"id":"1162951472976252938","channel_id":"1162951296643498015","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"","timestamp":"2023-10-15T03:13:57.751000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1162951472758136892","filename":"ilya_extra.png","size":68314,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162951296643498015/1162951472758136892/ilya_extra.png?ex=66a90335&is=66a7b1b5&hm=aa68cdc1ac53a9a0bc11777238d343ee0ae68ec95d759abaf97051f6a63898bb&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1162951296643498015/1162951472758136892/ilya_extra.png?ex=66a90335&is=66a7b1b5&hm=aa68cdc1ac53a9a0bc11777238d343ee0ae68ec95d759abaf97051f6a63898bb&","width":900,"height":120,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"ahgKCYBVNlCKd6iWAZoIkrk=","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"alteras"},{"id":"1162951496716009525","channel_id":"1162951296643498015","author":{"id":"198327629047267328","username":"alteras","avatar":"a1dca50d42fb3590de37e118c021b985","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Alteras","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Hobbies:**\nExploring

(78)\nGender: Female\nRace: Human\nPERSONAL:\n\nSexuality: Undefined (Beyond mortal desires)\nHigh Concept: A mysterious witch shrouded in darkness, manipulating the strings of fate and seeking ultimate knowledge and power.\nBackstory: Oakvile native. Dame Calluna Lo, once a teacher of many magically inclined Heroes in the guild, fell from grace due to her insatiable thirst for knowledge causing her to lead a doomed expedition into the abyss to recover knowledge, with most of her students in tow. It is unknown what exactly transpired there, save that she was among the only survivors. \n\nAffiliations: Hero's Guild, Estranged.\n\nPHYSICAL:\n\nAppearance: Cloaked in tattered, charcoal robes, Dame Calluna Lo's pale skin contrasts sharply with her dark attire. Her eyes, once vibrant green, are now obscured by a blindfold, and further clouded by cataracts.

Pride ran strong in the family, and everyone was eager to add to the legacy in some way. When the call for help was heard, every Solheim was eager to answer it and prove themselves. \n\nOver the years, as the magic in the family declined, more of the family ended up dying on some reckless foolhardy glory-seeking quest. What finally put an end to their feral thirst for monster-hunting was when they noticed their family treasures and weapons were being looted and stolen by their allies. \n\nThe Solheim still yearn to answer the call to adventure, for monster slaying and dragon hunting, but they are more careful now, and they must be content to grind their fangs against petty foes, small prey ‚Ä¶ lest their allies see just how far they‚Äôve truly fallen from power, lest they lose every last treasure enabling their dwindling fires. \n\nIn a fit of rage, Carter considers breaking the rest of the hidden Solheim treasures, but her betters have persuaded her otherwise; she agrees with her Master that she does not wish to leave a dark mark in the Solheim history.","timestamp":"2023-10-28T04:58:18.854000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-28T05:02:45.440000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_coiiapse"},{"id":"1167689269809266730","channel_id":"1167688772742295572","author":{"id":"993397722285613087","username":"_coiiapse","avatar":"dbe57749dde8b2b9469958957c5e2e40","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"COIIAPS3","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Affiliations**: Guild of Heroes; House Solheim\n**Guild Rank**: Hero\n\n# PHYSICAL\n**Weapons & Armor**\n- Machete\n- 2 Spell Cannons (Pistols)\n- Form fitting leather armour, a heavy two layered cape that helps to resists simple detection spells, and boots that have rudimentary enchantments to be silent\n**Items & Personal Belongings**\n- Her hat, inlaid with unremarkable gems\n- Small haversack\n- Rope, Paper\n**Skills & Abilities**\n- Marksmanship: Years of honing her skill and body ensure that she is no greenhorn with her weapon.

As a result, she has some knowledge on how to operate and repair things, all kinds of things ‚Ä¶ malfunctioning turrets, heavy gates, steering wheels ‚Ä¶ all to avoid a truly sad and pathetic demise.\n- Acrobatic: She is a treasure hunter that must not fall prey to traps or succumb to whatever lies within dangerous chambers. As a long-range specialist, she is also incredibly conscious about her positioning and quick to move wherever she needs to. \n**Spells & Magic**\n- Fire Magic (Flawed): In the past, the Solheim could actually use Light Magic to heal others, break curses, or eradicate fractures upon the land (whatever that means). The bloodline is so diluted now that the holy nature of the magic is gone, leaving only fire in their veins. It is predicted that in a few generations, the bloodline will lose the ability to cast magic altogether, as Carter and her peers must rely on ancient treasures, and forgotten relics, to even draw the fire from their veins.

It appears to her as lines that she describes as silk.\n\nTilolana‚Äôs posse wings that allow them to hover during movement, they are not strong enough for flight.\n\nSignificantly better at seeing within the dark than regular humans.\n\n**Spells & Magic:**\n*Arcana of Blue:* Creation of ice structures and she can form full barriers of mana.\n\n*Arcana of Brown:* She can strengthen the spells of others enhancing their power.\n\n*Arcana of Red:* Several offensive fire spells.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nICorus is a spell caster so close-range combat is dangerous.\n\nScouting is her strength; She would rather flee then fight.\n\nHailing from the past of beast lord, her history is a sore spot which could be exploited.\n\nCold weather.\n\n\n**Other:**\n**FLUFF** (Optional)\n**Hobbies: **\nPlaying several different instruments.\n\nCollecting a large amount of sentimental objects.\n\nReading of heroism.\n\n**Quote\\s:** ‚ÄúFor everything, their must be an opposite.‚Äù\n\n**Theme:**https://youtu.be/rAu3q4goZow?si=1D0R-7pQs1uhGJJr","timestamp":"2023-11-17T03:29:35.349000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-17T05:10:37.192000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üëç"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":4,"components":[],"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1174914256362295366","channel_id":"1174914202742313000","author":{"id":"214058147499868160","username":"kyroscript","avatar":"8d00af5699209435f00ea5ac61a9e81b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"**Backstory:**\nBlood running down my face, flames crossing my vision, and my face pressed against the cold stone of the ground. I can still remember my predecessor laying on the ground dead from a stray arrow. ‚ÄúWe can live in harmony‚Äù, that was the last thing he said to me. All I could do was hide and watch as they tore down our home from the outside. All around our village, I could hear the men screaming. Raging at a kind not their own, for sins not our doing.\n\nWhile the magics of the Glass Ocean slowly killed the land, they blamed the Beast Folk simply because they use more magics then them. As I looked up at the smoke of my now burning childhood reaching into the upper atmosphere, the seed of a thought bore itself deep into my mind. Perhaps, we are the reason their will be never peace.\n\nDays later the destroyed village of Atheey would be a turning point for the Laurellian Queen and its people. This would be the last time the hurtful anger of those who disliked Beastfolk would be allowed quarter, even it if hurt the country in the long term. The Queen swore to create a haven for all beast folk that would otherwise be unfairly punished by others. And for the first time Laurellia shut the world out, only those of beastfolk origin may enter its cities any longer. This has remained the law for around three hundred years since that moment.\n\n------\n\n‚ÄúICorus.‚Äù The voice of James broke her daydream. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt updated on the mana movements in a while, are we still following the lines?‚Äù\nWithin the distant forest, ICorus and three others walked forward towards their aim.\n\nColored air exhaled from her lungs. Tilolanas carry some amount of feathers, but their insides are very susceptible to the cold. In general, they prefer warm climates year-round or staying inside for long periods. \n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She raised her hand and pointed forward. ‚ÄúThe cult is definitely in this direction.‚Äù\n\nStepping across chunks of mud that stuck to her feet the group moved slowly. Besides the cold, it was also humid, which only fostered her pain. \n\n‚ÄúGood‚Äù James replied. ‚ÄúNow listen, I know you are not preferable to combat. Zi and I have worked together for quite some time. Let us take the front and you provide support; I don‚Äôt expect them have too much fire power.‚Äù\n\nShe nodded, but inside she couldn‚Äôt help but feel the swealing anxiety. The lines of mana they were following were like a footprint. All forms of displacement within the world leave a trace of energy for a time, but these felt intention, like something wanted to be found. For whatever reason, ICorus didn‚Äôt explain this to them though.\n\n‚ÄúI have been meaning to ask, what are Laurellia‚Äôs cities like? I have never seen inside their walls‚Äù Zi asked her. There were several seconds the questions floated before she shook her head. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, that was insensitive of me. It‚Äôs just I always wonder, and you never know when you won‚Äôt have the chance to ask again.‚Äù\n\nICorus looked down. ‚ÄúNo, its alright. I don‚Äôt mind telling you, but after this is over.‚Äù\n\nAs she looked up, she saw the village in the distance. Thousands of magic lines converged on the land before them and in the distance the burning horizon simmered below the surface into shadow.\n\n‚ÄúDeal. We are almost there, get ready.‚Äù","timestamp":"2023-11-17T03:29:47.568000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-17T04:22:16.514000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"kyroscript"},{"id":"1174914318442180618","channel_id":"1174914202742313000","author":{"id":"214058147499868160","username":"kyroscript","avatar":"8d00af5699209435f00ea5ac61a9e81b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"","timestamp":"2023-11-17T03:30:02.369000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1174914318148567062","filename":"aba8cfee037e4e7f54b2c2824da1888e.png","size":1704540,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1174914202742313000/1174914318148567062/aba8cfee037e4e7f54b2c2824da1888e.png?ex=66a906fa&is=66a7b57a&hm=2d209b06970eafa76b8e83a04992c6d9ecb97011a43d2e09a774641892ecbd74&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1174914202742313000/1174914318148567062/aba8cfee037e4e7f54b2c2824da1888e.png?ex=66a906fa&is=66a7b57a&hm=2d209b06970eafa76b8e83a04992c6d9ecb97011a43d2e09a774641892ecbd74&","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"ExgODwIHiGeGdYqFd5qIZ5d4dCCoJ4AK","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"kyroscript"}]
